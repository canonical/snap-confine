This directory contains optional assets that given some additional configuration allow
one to run spread tests completely offline. This is useful in certain situations, e.g.
limited or metered connection, no network, etc.

With the offline content in place tests run somewhat faster as one big part of the setup
is skipped (sbuild-createchroot). The overal result is very much smilar / identical
to if you were running online. In an emergency it is possible to convert your local online
setup to work offline (just type 'make') but this requires that:

 - you have working proxy for APT, e.g. apt-cacher-ng
 - the proxy is used by your system so you have some useful content there
   (edit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00proxy and insert something like
    acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.9.1:3141";
   this is easy to do if you use it for one full spread test in qemu
 - the APT_PROXY environment variable points to the same URL as used above
 - the IP address there is stable (ideally add it to your machine separately from
   your normal dynamic address) and is available even when offline.
 - you have the 'ubuntu-core', 'snapd-hacker-toolbelt' and 'hello-world' snaps installed
   locally.
 - you have sbuild set up and have appropriate chroots or can build one from your offline
   proxy.

Now all that you have to do is to put apt-cacher-ng into fully offline mode
(/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acnf.conf has the appropriate switch). With everything else intact
you should be able to type "make" here and end up with working offline spread tests.
